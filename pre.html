How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!

If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
enemy - "Time Wasting".

What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
applies even more to the online world, than in regular
business.

You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.

And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
simply to get more done - in less time.

So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
you do to avoid them?

1. Retyping the same old thing time and time again.
2. Failing to manage your email effectively.
3. Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.
4. Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.
