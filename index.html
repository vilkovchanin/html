    <h1 id="header">How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>

    <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/alarm.jpg" width="307" height="450" alt="Clock" align="right" hspace="50" vspace="20" border="0"></a>

    <p>If you're <strong>in an internet marketing business, then
        you've probably</strong> already come face-to-face with your #1
        enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

    <p>What you <em>need to know is that "Time Is Money"</em>. And this
        applies even more to the online world, than in regular
        business.</p>

    <p>You see, <b>can become</b> an online entrepreneur. It
        doesn't <i>involve start-up</i> capital or expensive equipment to
        start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</p>

    <p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
        become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
        simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

    <p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
        you do to avoid them?</p>

    <ol start="0">
        <li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
        <li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
        <li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
        <li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>

    <p>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</p>
    <p>------------------------------------------------</p>

    <p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
        retype the same old simple information.</p>

    <p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
        signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
        communicating words quickly.</p>

    <p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
        enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
        having to type the same thing twice.</p>

    <p>I use this utility <a href="http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot" target="_blank"
            title="link to hell">http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot</a> , but
        there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
        available.</p>

    <p>>Failing to manage your email effectively.</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------------</p>

    <p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
    <p>be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
    <p>own installed on your computer.</p>

    <p>Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
        set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
        trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
        emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
        into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
        through them afterwards and pull back any that have
        been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

    <p>Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
        organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
        FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more. </p>
